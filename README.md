# concrete_compressive_strength_deep_learning_detail
This machine learning project uses deep learning (keras) to predict the compressive strength of concrete from other features -- quantity of cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate and the age of the concrete. Data is downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Concrete+Compressive+Strength

This notebook intends to walk people through building a deep learning model with keras step by step. Detailed comments are made : )
